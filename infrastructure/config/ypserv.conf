#
# ypserv.conf	In this file you can set certain options for the NIS server,
#		and you can deny or restrict access to certain maps based
#		on the originating host.
#
#		See ypserv.conf(5) for a description of the syntax.
#

# Some options for ypserv. This things are all not needed, if
# you have a Linux net.

# Should we do DNS lookups for hosts not found in the hosts table ?
# This option is ignored in the moment.
dns: no

# How many map file handles should be cached ?
files: 30

# Should we register ypserv with SLP ?
# slp: no
# After how many seconds we should re-register ypserv with SLP ?
# slp_timeout: 3600

# xfr requests are only allowed from ports < 1024
xfr_check_port: yes

# The following, when uncommented,  will give you shadow like passwords.
# Note that it will not work if you have slave NIS servers in your
# network that do not run the same server as you.

# Host                     : Domain  : Map              : Security 
#
# *                        : *       : passwd.byname    : port 
# *                        : *       : passwd.byuid     : port

# Not everybody should see the shadow passwords, not secure, since
# under MSDOG everbody is root and can access ports < 1024 !!!
*			   : *       : shadow.byname    : port
*			   : *       : passwd.adjunct.byname : port

# If you comment out the next rule, ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd will
# look for YP_SECURE and YP_AUTHDES in the maps. This will make
# the security check a little bit slower, but you only have to
# change the keys on the master server, not the configuration files
# on each NIS server.
# If you have maps with YP_SECURE or YP_AUTHDES, you should create
# a rule for them above, that's much faster.
# *                        : *       : *                : none
